\section{Introduction}

The purpose of this lab is
to evaluate the effects of poles, zeros and the gain
on first-order and second-order control systems.

After this lab, students will be able
to determine the effects of poles, zeros, and gain
as well the imaginary and real parts of poles,
and the damping ratio
on overshoot, settling time, rise time, peak time
and the overall shape of the step response.

Additionally, students will be able to plot the transient responses of systems, which include
the impulse response, step response, ramp response, and parabola response. The MATLAB \mintinline{matlab}{linearSystemAnalyzer} is also introduced as a tool for analysis.
